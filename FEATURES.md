# Orion - Test Framework Features

Let's assume Ivan recently started development of Python based Test Automation Framework. 
Trace the challenges he can face and develop a solution around it. For starters, Ivan wants to test an e-commerce app.
A small Proof-Of-Concept (POC) is more than enough. Nothing fancy as of now.

1. FEA-001: Initial project setup -> DONE
   + Ivan can clone Project Orion from git easily and start development asap.
   + Project can be supported in Linux, Mac OS, Windows platforms.
   + As of now, any 1 platform support is good enough to get started.
   + Ivan's computer can have multiple versions of Python already installed.
   + Use latest versions of technologies available.
